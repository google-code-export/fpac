fpac.sh		Shell script to start/stop fpac 
fpaccfg		dumps the configuration of fpac
fpacnode	The FPAC node client
fpacroute	daemon for traceroute
fpacshell	(node) Runs a shell with MD5 protection
fpacstat	computes the traffic statistics of the trunks
fpacwdog	simple watchdog that sends a character to a serial port
fpacwpd		The white pages database server daemon
fpad		The FPAC pad. Access from/to AX25/NetRom/ROSE
mailbbs		Simple mailer to send Fpac's services messages to a BBS
mkissattach	** Obsolete - Multiple kissattach
mon_tcp		Sends/receive monitoring frames to a remote BBS via TCP/IP
monitor		Simple monitoring tool

wpstress	** Obsolete - WP utility
yapp		To remotely download or upload files to your node with YAPP transfert protocol.

See INSTALL for configuration and installation instructions.

PREREQUISITES
=============

You need to have current libax25 installed.

Ensure ax25-apps and ax25-tools are also installed. Ensure all configuration files 
exist (use `make installconf' to install defaults).

Installation paths can be changed to suit local requirements, see ./configure --help or INSTALL for 
details. Ensure you install in the same paths used by libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools.

STARTING FPAC
=============
To start fpac, use the fpac.sh script

TODO
====
	* To be compatible with libax25-0.0.9 and up now
	* Upgrade with last ROSE fonctionalities
	  (UI frames routed like I frames for APRS and IP datagrams and increase MTU )
	* Do automatic cleaning of WP database.
	* Find a solution for automatic and dynamic routing.
	* Support an online and switchable compression algorithm.
	* Flexnet Digipeating or perhaps convert flexnet destinations collected in WP
	* Fix all bugs you can found and report.
	* Add new fonctionnalities you request ;-)

You can post your bug reports or requests in the Rose/Fpac mailing list.

=================================
F6BVP - December 2010

	* Automatic routing has been improved in ROSE Linux module and should be found in next kernel release around
	  2.6.37 or 38. Dynamic packet routing is still far away (...)

	* >3.28.1 (F6BVP)
	  Investigate the issue when call <portname> <callsign> is actually now interpreted as call <callsign> via <callsign>
	  Close rose sockets when FPAC is shut down.
	  When issuing a call from fpacnode and the call is not in fpac wp data base but
  	   a node with same DNIC address is connected (routes), the call should go through this route.
