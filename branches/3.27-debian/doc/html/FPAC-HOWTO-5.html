<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Configuration of FPAC</A></H2>

<P>FPAC is configured by only one file. This file is named "fpac.conf" and 
<B>must</B> be located in <B>/etc/ax25</B> directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 The fpac.conf configuration file</A>
</H2>

<P>Here is an example of fpac.conf.
<P>This file is made of keywords to which are given values or block of values. 
A block is always ended by a "end" keyword alone.
Keywords are not case dependant, 
but values are often case dependant.

<LI><B>L2call</B> is the main callsign seen by users. Connecting this callsign will give
access to fpacnode. Using this callign as digipeater will give access to
local or remote station via the network.</LI>
<LI><B>L3call</B> is the callsign used to tranport the X25 frames. This callsign should
not be connected by users (no text or other thing is sent). It will be used
by remote switches to tranport the X25 circuits with the PID 01 (X25). Using
this callsign as digipeater will give a silent connection and disconnection,
no message or report will be sent. Mostly interesting for machines such as BBS.</LI>
<LI><B>DNIC</B> is the country designator. It follows the CCITT standard. 
It is 2080 for France. Some designators are given in annex.</LI>
<LI><B>Address</B> is the numerical reference of the switch. This address is generaly
copied from the telephone number hierarchy.</LI>

<P>The Command section includes a list of keywords which will appear in the main menu 
of fpacnode. If no value is given to the keyword, this last one will be 
deleted from the default commands of the menu.
<P>A keyword identical to an existing command will redefine it. So the 
previous default command will be replaced by the new one.
<P>Upcase characters are the mandatory characters to be received for the
command to be interpreted.
<P>The value is a command which can be executed by LINUX. The user will be 
linked to this command, sending what he types and receiving the answers,
until the commands ends. Then the user will go back to the fpacnode menu.
<P>A special command is <B>connect</B> which sends a L2 or L3 connection.
If a port is specified after "connect" then a L2 local connection will be 
issued. If no port is specified, a L3 NetRom connection will be done if 
the callsign is a known NetRom node or a L3 ROSE connection. In case of a
L3 ROSE connection, if no address is specified (address is always 10 digits)
then a route will be guessed (if the callisgn is known) from the FPAC white
pages database.
