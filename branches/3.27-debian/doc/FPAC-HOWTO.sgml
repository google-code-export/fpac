<abstract>
The Linux Operating System has a kernel buil-in protocol named ROSE. 
FPAC is a set of tools to configure and interface ROSE.
This document aims to describe how to install and configure FPAC.

<sect><heading>Introduction.
<p>
ROSE protocol is based on X25 and allows fast and efficient packet
switching with a very small protocol overhead (only three bytes).
<p>
Before configuring and running FPAC, the AX25 and ROSE kernel 
must have been installed and running.
<p>
If you need more information on AX25 and ROSE, read carefully
Terry's AX25-HOWTO. Parts of this documentation are taken from this HOWTO.

<sect1><heading>Version of FPAC.
<p>
This document refers to FPAC version 3.09. 

<sect1><heading>Where to obtain new versions of this document.
<p>
To day this document is only available with FPAC distribution. 

<sect1><heading>Other related documentation.
<p>
There is a lot of related documentation. There are many documents that relate
to Linux networking in more general ways and I strongly recommend you also
read these as they will assist you in your efforts and provide you with
stronger insight into other possible configurations.

They are:

documents.

<sect><heading>FPAC tools
<p>
FPAC distribution includes a set of tools. Hereafter is a brief 
description of each of them.

<sect1><heading>fpad
<p>
fpad is the main piece of code. It makes the interface between AX25 
(and other protocols) and ROSE. It allows connections from ax25 users 
to the network and vice-versa in pseudo-digipeating mode, this is
without first connecting a node application.
<p>
FPAC will give some information on the link setup and will report any incident.
<p>
Example of connection via fpad :
<tscreen><verb>
Cmd: C F6FBB-1 via F6FBB-8

*** Connected to f6fbb-1
*** WP routing F6FBB-1 @ 2080,931502
*** Connection done
[FBB-7.00g-AB1FHMRX$]
Hello Jean-Paul >

*** Disconnected from F6FBB-1 at F6FBB-11 @ 2080,931502
*** 0000 - Remote Station cleared connection
*** Disconnected
Cmd:
</verb></tscreen>
<p>
FPAC includes a white pages system which records the address of each node
and user of the network. This information is also distributed to every other
FPAC system in the network. This allows to connect any known callsign 
without giving any node or routing information.

<sect1><heading>fpacnode
<p>
fpacnode acts like the linuxnode. Many parts of the code have been taken 
from linuxnode. Some additions have been made for the ROSE protocol.
<p>
fpacnode makes the interface to ax25/netrom/rose and tcpip networking.
It also reports informations and statistics on the system.
<p>
fpacnode has a built-in set of commands. They can be disabled or new 
commands may be easily added. A second set of commands is added
after the SYS (sysop) command is successfull.
<p>
Password to change to sys mode is either plain text, netrom or MD2/MD5 keys.
<p>
Here are some examples of the node commands :

<p><bf/A command/ gives the list of aliases. An alias allow to connect
any callsign (even remote) using a local callsign. For instance
callsign F6FBB-3 will route to the cluster F6KRQ-3 through the
network. Aliases may be also directly connected by the user without
using fpacnode.

<sect1>fpacshell
<p>fpacshell opens a LINUX shell session to the user, normally in sysop mode.
This session is opened mostly for maintenance with root priviledges.
<p>For safety reasons a password accepting plain text, NetRom key or MD2/MD5
key is provided.
<p>fpacshell is run from the command or sysop section of the FPAC configuration
file. See <ref id="sysop-section" name="Sysop section">.

<sect1>fpacstat
<p>fpacstat is the statistics applications. It computes the traffic statistics
of the trunks (L3 links between switches) and updates each minute a last-hour
file <bf>/var/ax25/fpac/fpacstat.dat</bf> and each hour a last-day file
<bf>/var/ax25/fpac/fpacstat.day</bf>.
<p>These files can be read at any time and sent to the user.
<p>The "-c" option writes &lt;CR&gt; characters instead of &lt;LF&gt; to be
compatible with the packet radio protocole in which &lt;CR&gt; characters are
used as end of line. 

<sect1>fpacwpd
<p>fpacwpd is the white pages database server daemon. It will answer to any local or
remote query. The database is stored in <bf>/var/ax25/fpac/fpacwp2.dat</bf>.
<p>To get a report on this server, only connect WP via ROSE/L3 and type ":". The
server will dump its current status. Type return to end the connection.

<sect><heading>Installation of FPAC
<p>
ROSE kernel must be installed for FPAC to work. If you are running 
kernels from <bf/2.0.33/ to <bf/2.0.35/, apply the patch <bf/rose0728/ to the
kernel. 
If you are running 2.0.36, you don't have anything to do. 
<p>ROSE is configured by the rsparms file in <bf>/etc/ax25</bf>.
This file will be created or replaced when running <bf/fpad/.
So ROSE kernel does not need any special configuration. All is done when
starting fpad.
<sect1>Binaries
<p>
Copy the set of applications from fpac/bin to <bf>/usr/sbin</bf> or
<bf>/usr/local/bin</bf> directory. 
Add the line <bf>/usr/sbin/fpac.sh</bf> or <bf>/usr/local/bin/fpac.sh</bf> to
the rc file, <bf/after the ax25 initialisation/.

<sect1>Directories
<p>The configuration files are in <bf>/etc/ax25</bf> and the tree of the help
files is in <bf>/etc/ax25/fpac</bf>. See section <ref id="help-files" 
name="Help files">.
<p>The working directory <bf>/var/ax25/fpac</bf> will be created when running
FPAC. The files created at runtime will be put in this directory

<sect><heading>Starting FPAC
<p>FPAC is run from the fpac.sh file.

<sect1><heading>The fpac.sh start file
<p>This file creates a shell to give to fpac and fpacstat the needed
environment. It includes a PATH to the bin directory of the fpac binaries. 

<sect1><heading>Calling fpac.sh during linux start-up
<p>To start fpac, only run <bf>/usr/sbin/fpac.sh</bf> from your rc.local or
start-up file.
<p>There is no need to add a &amp; (ampersand) at the end of the line. 
<p>fpac.sh <bf/must/ be run after the ax25 layers are fully initalised.

<sect><heading>Configuration of FPAC
<p>
FPAC is configured by only one file. This file is named "fpac.conf" and 
<bf>must</bf> be located in <bf>/etc/ax25</bf> directory.

<sect1><heading>The fpac.conf configuration file
<p>
Here is an example of fpac.conf.
<p>
This file is made of keywords to which are given values or block of values. 
A block is always ended by a "end" keyword alone.
Keywords are not case dependant, 
but values are often case dependant.

<item><bf/L2call/ is the main callsign seen by users. Connecting this callsign will give
access to fpacnode. Using this callign as digipeater will give access to
local or remote station via the network.
<item><bf/L3call/ is the callsign used to tranport the X25 frames. This callsign should
not be connected by users (no text or other thing is sent). It will be used
by remote switches to tranport the X25 circuits with the PID 01 (X25). Using
this callsign as digipeater will give a silent connection and disconnection,
no message or report will be sent. Mostly interesting for machines such as BBS.
<item><bf/DNIC/ is the country designator. It follows the CCITT standard. 
It is 2080 for France. Some designators are given in annex.
<item><bf/Address/ is the numerical reference of the switch. This address is generaly
copied from the telephone number hierarchy.
<item><bf/Coverage/ is the list of addresses that a switch will answer to added to the
generic address
<item><bf/InetPort/ is the port number (decimal) listened by FPAC for telnet connections
<item><bf/Password/ is the word or sentence to compute the password for the SYS command
<item><bf/City/ is the location of the switch
<item><bf/Locator/ is the QTH locator of the switch

<sect1><heading>Command section
<p>The Command section adds or remove commands to/from the main menu. Think that
these commands will be executed with the root priviledges, so avoid if possible
destructive commands.

Command
        BBs = /usr/sbin/call_tcp serveur 1022

end
</verb></tscreen>
<p>The Command section includes a list of keywords which will appear in the main menu 
of fpacnode. If no value is given to the keyword, this last one will be 
deleted from the default commands of the menu.
<p>A keyword identical to an existing command will redefine it. So the 
previous default command will be replaced by the new one.
<p>Upcase characters are the mandatory characters to be received for the
command to be interpreted.
<p>The value is a command which can be executed by LINUX. The user will be 
linked to this command, sending what he types and receiving the answers,
until the commands ends. Then the user will go back to the fpacnode menu.
<p>A special command is <bf/connect/ which sends a L2 or L3 connection.
If a port is specified after "connect" then a L2 local connection will be 
issued. If no port is specified, a L3 NetRom connection will be done if 
the callsign is a known NetRom node or a L3 ROSE connection. In case of a
L3 ROSE connection, if no address is specified (address is always 10 digits)
then a route will be guessed (if the callisgn is known) from the FPAC white
pages database.

<sect1><heading>Sysop section<label id="sysop-section">
<p>The Sysop section adds extended commands to the main menu when the SYSop
command has succeded. Generally, maintenance commands are added. Think that
these commands will be executed with the root priviledges, so avoid if 
possible destructive commands. The SYSop command is redefined to allow
running a LINUX shell via <bf/fpacshell/.

<p>Each block gets the name of the adjacent switch. This name will be used later
in the routing section. Be aware of the letter case. Four keywords must be
defined.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Path/ specifies the callsign/ssid of the adjacent switch optionnaly
followed by one or more digipeaters
<item><bf/DNIC/ specifies the DNIC (4 digits) of the adjacent switch
<item><bf/Address/ specifies the main address of the adjacent switch
<item><bf/Port/ specifies the port on which the adjacent switch will be linked.
<item><bf/NoWP = 1/ specifies that the adjacent does not support white pages (default 0).

<p>A DNIC line will define that all the following lines will refer to this DNIC
(country), until a new DNIC definition or the end of the block.
<p>If the DNIC is declared as "0", then the following address declarations 
include the DNIC, so may have up to 10 digits.
<p>If the DNIC is declared as a 4 digits string, then the following addess
declarations will have up to 6 digits.
<p>If the numerical information is smaller than 6 digits long, it means that all
addresses starting with this numerical information will be routed to the
corresponding switch.
<p>If the numerical information is replaced by a "*", then all the addresses
of the DNIC will be routed to the corresponding switch.
<p>The name of the switch is the one taken from the <bf/node/ section.
<p>A longuest numerical information will have a highest priority. For instance :
<verb>
        DNIC = 2080
        981 = Rebigue
        981501 = Prat
</verb>
<p>means that all addresses starting by 981 for the DNIC 2080 will be routed to
Rebigue except 981501 which will be routed to Prat. The order is not important,
the addresses are sorted in the routing algorithm.
