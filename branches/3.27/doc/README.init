Init scripts for the AX.25 subsystem.

The following scripts are included with this package:
	ax25
	ax25-up
	ax25-down

These scripts are meant to be used with a modern Linux OS that uses rc.init 
for managing services.

They are specifically designed to be used on Debian.


ax25
----
The ax25 script itself is meant to be copied in to /etc/init.d. It is the interface 
with the init.d system and is used to call the ax25-up or ax25-down scripts as 
appropriate during system startup or shutdown, respectively.

In order to use this script, after copying it to /etc/init.d, issue the following command:

# update-rc.d ax25 defaults 80 20

This will create the necessary links to start and stop the ax25 subsystem near the 
end of boot and at the beginning of shutdown.

There shouldn't be too much you need to change in this script, unless you want to change 
some of the stuff in the status section.

Just ensure the paths to ax25-up and ax25-down are correct if you don.t put them in /etc/ax25.

You can call the ax25 script with the following functions:
	start
	stop
	restart

This allows you to manually bring up or take down the AX.25 subsystem, as necessary.


ax25-up
-------
This is the real workhorse script. It is used to start up all the necessary elements to 
get your AX.25 system up and running.

Copy it to /etc/ax25 and make sure it is executable. It will be called by init.d (ax25) 
when it is necessary to bring up the AX.25 system.

If you look in the script, it should be pretty straight forward.

In general, network devices are created (ax, nr, etc) using kissattach (and nrattach if 
you are using Net/ROM). Parameters are adjusted for each port, as needed to suit the situation.

Then, the daemons are started in the desired sequence, writing out a PID file to keep track of 
the processes and ensuring they start.

You can comment or uncomment blocks of code for the daemons you are or are not using.

Add in additional blocks if you are starting other daemons (make sure you also add 
corresponding blocks to ax25-down to kill them).


ax25-down
---------
This script is used to do a graceful shutdown of all the AX.25 related daemons.

Copy it to /etc/ax25 and make sure it is executable. It will be called by init.d (ax25) when 
it is necessary to shut down the AX.25 system.

What this script does is look for the PID file that was created when the daemon.s were started, 
and kill them in sequence.

Then it removes any ax, ROSE, and nr devices from the networking subsystem.

The result is a clean system that is ready to be restarted, if you change configurations.
