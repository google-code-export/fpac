== FPAC and Linux RMS ==

There are two ways to define an RMS command within fpac.conf (in the Command section):

The first way calls the RMS Gate direct.
    `RMS = /usr/local/bin/rmsgw -P 0 %U`

The second way connects to the the RMS Gate like a RF connect request.
    `RMS = connect k4gbb-10 3100352726`

The second way is preferred way. It allows the FPAC node to supply the
correct line ends and prevent the overwriting of lines supplied by the CMS.

You will likely also want to define an application line in the Applications section:

     `K4GBB-10 = /usr/bin/rmsgw -P 0 %U`

Note that the -P option defines the axport (from the /etc/axports) file to connect with. This MUST be a valid port that has been defined in /etc/rmsgw/channels.xml for this configuration. If you don't use a valid axport/channel, then rmsgw won't start (you'll get a banner and that is it if you were to try connecting from the command line).


There is a newer rmschanstat script available from the LinuxRMS Yahoo! group than is included with the linuxrms source. You will want to get this newer script as it supports FPAC.

In this new script, you *need to check the path to fpad* and correct it based on your installation.


There have been reports of some problems with the above RMS command. If you get an error like this:

{{{
K4GBB-8 (Commands = ?) : rms
axutils: SSID must follow '-' and be numeric in the range 0-15 - '3100352726'
}}}

Then one option is to change the command to:

    `RMS = connect k4gbb-10, 3100352726`

Note the "," in there.

It seems that this also may be related to the callsign you have defined for the port in axports. If port 0 in axports has the same callsign and SSID as the call used in the Command and Application in fpac.conf (ie in this example, port 0 also has the call k4gbb-10), you may run in to this problem. Changing the SSID of the call in axports to anything else seems to resolve the issue too.
