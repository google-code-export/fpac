== FPAC and Linux RMS ==

There are two ways to define an RMS command within fpac.conf (in the Command section):

The first way calls the RMS Gate direct.
    `RMS = /usr/local/bin/rmsgw -P 0 %U`

The second way connects to the the RMS Gate like a RF connect request.
    `RMS = connect k4gbb-10 3100352726`

The second way is preferred way. It allows the FPAC node to supply the
correct line ends and prevent the overwriting of lines supplied by the CMS.

You will likely also want to define an application line in the Applications section:

     `K4GBB-10 = /usr/bin/rmsgw -P 0 %U`

Note that the -P option defines the axport (from the /etc/axports) file to connect with. This MUST be a valid port that has been defined in /etc/rmsgw/channels.xml for this configuration. If you don't use a valid axport/channel, then rmsgw won't start (you'll get a banner and that is it if you were to try connecting from the command line).
