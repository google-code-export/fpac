DESCRIPTION
        Checks if an Internet host can be reached through the network by sending
        an ICMP Echo Request packet to the host and waiting for it to
        reply. If a reply is received the round-trip-time (RTT)
        between the local and remote hosts is shown.

        If an optional length is specified the data portion of the
        packet is filled with length number of bytes.
